Unity 3D presentation template
===============

This is simple template created on Unity3D for presentations Powerpoint or Keynote style but with the capabilities of a 3D engine.
There are 20 slides rotation on a carrousel type gallery. These are 40 planes floating parented to an empty game object that rotates with the left and right keys. There are 20 slides in total plus 20 GUI aditional planes in front of each slide to increase the 3D effect.
It would be very useful if someone could write a script to automate the use and management of slides because at the moment is a manual task.

You might also need to adjust your screen resolution to fit the GUI elements and the time widget.
Created on Unity 4.
